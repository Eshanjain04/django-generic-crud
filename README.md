# Django Generic CRUD

Django Generic CRUD is an experimental project aimed at generating a generic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for any basic models in a Django application. The key concept is to leverage Django's capabilities to dynamically fetch models based on app name and model name.

## Overview

The project includes a dedicated model that stores information about the app-name and model-name for which the CRUD interface is desired. The API endpoint utilizes a keyword to identify the target model for adding, retrieving, or updating data. The relevant data is fetched from the model that contains the app-name and model-name, and the corresponding operations are performed.

## Features

- **Dynamic CRUD:** Utilize Django to dynamically fetch and interact with models based on app and model names.
- **Scalability:** The project is designed to support multiple table inputs for enhanced flexibility.

## Future Plans

In the upcoming phases, the project aims to introduce support for multiple table inputs, expanding its capabilities further.

## Bulk Uploader

The project also includes a small utility for bulk uploading data into any model. The bulk uploader requires configuration details for the target model, such as app-name, model-name, headers of the Excel file, and a validation schema in JSON format for the data.

## Usage

1. **Generic CRUD API Endpoint:**
   - Use a keyword in the API endpoint to identify the target model.
   - Fetch data from the model containing app-name and model-name.
   - Perform operations accordingly.

2. **Bulk Upload Service:**
   - Configure the model for bulk upload, including app-name, model-name, Excel headers, and a validation schema.
   - Upload an Excel file.
   - Validate the header and data against the provided schema.
   - If validation passes, enter the data into the respective model.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure the models for CRUD and bulk upload.
3. Run the Django application.
